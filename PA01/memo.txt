1. After reading in tinyST.txt there are 10 entries (13 characters in the file, but three redundancies. Hash keys are unique). After deleting "S" and "A", there are 8 valid entries but still 10 entries overall.    

2. Run time in ms: 
Symbol table Search Time 140
Separate Chaining Search Time 90
Linear Probing Search Time 45
Sequential Search Time 42065

The times may vary, of course, on different computers. These results were obtained on my 3 y/o macbook laptop. What's important to me is the difference in performance among different tables. 

3. As expected, the two hash tables were the fastest since the lookup/insert time
is on average constant (Linear probing came out consistently faster, but this can be a result of many factors). Next came the sorted symbol table, which is only slightly slower. The sequential search is the slowest by far, since every operation is linear. 

4. The file tale.txt has 139043 words (based on wc -w tale.txt). 

5. It has 19695 unique words (based on our very simple definition, considering capital/small letters and punctuations as different). See uniqueWords.txt.

6. The most common word is 'the' (not surprisingly), which appears 7515 times.
